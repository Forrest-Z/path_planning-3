# path_planning

This local path planner is designed for our driverless car project. We have developed it on the concept of Frenet Frames, presented by Sebastian Thrun in ICRA 2010. Our path
planner safely avoids obstacles and generates optimal trajectories on highways as well as inner-city roads with dynamic transit situations.
